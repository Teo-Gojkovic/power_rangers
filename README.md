# Team School Project: Sensor Communication with Server

## Project Overview

This project is a collaborative effort by our team as part of our school curriculum. The goal is to design and implement a system where a sensor communicates with a server, and the servers stores the received data into a CSV file for further analysis.

## Objectives

1. **Sensor Communication**: Establish a reliable communication channel between the sensor and the server.
2. **Data Storage**: Implement functionality on the server to store incoming sensor data into a CSV file.
3. **Team Collaboration**: Work together as a team to design, develop, and test the system.

## Project Components

- **Sensor**: Captures data and sends it to the server.
- **Server**: Receives data from the sensor and processes it.
- **CSV Storage**: Stores the processed data in a structured CSV format.

## Technologies

- Programming Language: [Specify language(s), e.g., Python, C++]
- Communication Protocol: [Specify protocol, e.g., HTTP, MQTT]
- Tools: [Specify tools, e.g., Flask, Pandas]

## Team Roles

- **Team Lead**: [Name]
- **Backend Developer**: [Name]
- **Sensor Integration Specialist**: [Name]
- **Data Analyst**: [Name]

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Research and planning
- **Week 2-3**: Development and integration
- **Week 4**: Testing and finalization

## How to Run the Project

1. Set up the sensor and server environment.
2. Start the server application.
3. Ensure the sensor is configured to send data to the server.
4. Verify that the data is stored in the CSV file.
